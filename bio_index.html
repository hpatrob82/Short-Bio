                    <p>My name is Hilda Robles, I was born in Mexico but moved to Georgia in 1991 and lived in Georgia since. I served in the Marine Corps for 5 years as a Food Service Specialist, in other words as a " cook ". I worked in Home Healthcare
                        or about three years until I started the cohort with Digital Crafts.</p>
